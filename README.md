#Battleship: A day that will live in infamy

 ###Purpose

 the purpose of this program was to get the battleship test file to pass the first 18 tests. We successfully accomplished this(we think?).

 ###Comments

 we successfully passed all 18 tests with no errors or fails. We recognize that it is possible the program may not work put it did pass all tests.

 We attempted to created a Hole object to solve for test 14 but ended up finding a simpler(correct?) solution.

 ###Disclaimer
 not 100% sure if we were conscious  writing this README.
